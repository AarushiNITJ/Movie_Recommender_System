# Movie_Recommender_System
Built a movie recommender system with Streamlit 
In this project I have built a content based movie recommender system. The algorithm recommends products that are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past. This similarity (generally cosine similarity) is computed from the data we have about the items as well as the userâ€™s past preferences.

What it does:
